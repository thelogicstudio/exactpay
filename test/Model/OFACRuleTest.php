/**
 * OFACRuleTest Class Doc Comment
 *
 * @category    Class
 * @description This verification is an individual and entity screening service designed in coordination with the U.S. Department of Treasury. The search returns exact matches, as well as partial matches which meet a minimum threshold as defined by the user. The higher the threshold, the fewer results will be returned and the higher the likelihood of a match. For Example, if the minScore is set to a threshold of 50, it is likely to return more results than one could reasonably analyze.
